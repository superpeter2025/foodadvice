    "Whole Foods - Vegetables": (
        "Vegetables like leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, and other colorful veggies "
        "are nutrient-dense and essential for overall health. They provide vitamins, "
        "minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, supporting digestion, reducing inflammation, "
        "and protecting against chronic diseases. Including a variety of vegetables in "
        "your diet ensures a wide range of health benefits."
    ),
    "Whole Foods - Fruits": (
        "Low-glycemic fruits like berries, apples, and citrus are excellent sources of "
        "fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants. These fruits help regulate blood sugar levels, "

        "Moderation is key to enjoying their health benefits."
    ),
    "Healthy Proteins": (
        "Lean meats like chicken, turkey, and fish (e.g., salmon, sardines) provide high-quality "

        "and versatile source of complete protein."
    ),
    "Healthy Fats": (
        "Nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil are sources of healthy fats that support heart health, "

    ),
    "Whole Grains and Legumes": (
        "Whole grains like quinoa, brown rice, and oats, along with legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, "

        "and overall well-being."
    ),
    "AVOID! - Sugary Foods": (
        "Avoid sugary drinks, candy, desserts, and baked goods made with refined sugar. These can cause "
        "blood sugar spikes, contribute to insulin resistance, and increase the risk of chronic diseases "
        "like diabetes and heart disease."
    ),
    "AVOID! - Refined Carbohydrates": (
        "Refined carbohydrates like white bread, pasta, and processed snacks lack fiber and nutrients. "

    ),
    "AVOID! - Highly Processed Foods": (
        "Packaged meals, fast food, and processed meats contain unhealthy additives, high sodium, and "
